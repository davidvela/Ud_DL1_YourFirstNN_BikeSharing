# UDACITY DEEP LEARNING NANODEGREE - MY FIRST NN 
# BIKE SHARING 

## Introductions: 
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Instructions: 
1. Create a new conda environment: 
`conda create --name dlnd python=3 `

2. Enter your new environment:
`Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd `
` Windows: >> activate dlnd `

3. Ensure you have **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **pandas** and **jupyter notebook** installed by doing the folloiwng: 

`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`

4. open the notebook server: 
`jupyter notebook`


## What to do afterwards
If you're waiting for new content or to get the review back, here's a great video from [Frank Chen](https://vimeo.com/170189199) about the history of deep learning. It's a 45 minute video, sort of a short documentary, starting in the 1950s and bringing us to the current boom in deep learning and artificial intelligence.
